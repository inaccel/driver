## InAccel FPGA driver

The InAccel FPGA driver container allows the provisioning of the FPGA drivers
through the use of containers. This provides a few benefits over a standard
driver installation, for example:

* Ease of deployment
* Fast installation
* Reproducibility

The driver container can be used in standard Linux distributions such as Amazon
Linux, CentOS Linux and Ubuntu.
